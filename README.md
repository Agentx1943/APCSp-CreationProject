The creation project for AP Computer Science principles

The "Math Solver Time" HTML site is a compilation of solvers, where you can input some variable values, and the code of the site can solve, and return the answer in a plain text format in an answer box.

Each solver has its own small bordered box with an input form, a calculate button, and a smaller bordered box inside of which the answer with be outputted.

The answer "boxes" or squares will have a margin from the sides of the page and from each other, they will also wrap around to the bottom if the screen size is too small, or if the window size is changed.
